## Input
* Pre-registered list of patients for vaccination
* New registration of patients for vaccination
## Process
* Pre registered patients who had appointments verify the documents
* Verification is done with pre registered data of patients
* New registrations are added to the vaccinated log
* Total number of vaccine vials consumed is tracked for both type of vaccines
## Output
* Vaccinated data log is updated and new registrations are added to the end of the pre data list
* List of vaccinated patients along with total vials consumed is printed
